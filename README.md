# Binary CLassification using Neural Network
An L layer Deep Neural Network on Classifying labels based on features of data using Tensorflow library
Project 1 (Detecting breast cancer)

    Classifying Features  computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass as malignant
    or benign Using a Artificial neural network model in tensorlow using keras and optimizing the model using callback 
    like EarlyStopping and using Dropout Layers and evaluating model performance
